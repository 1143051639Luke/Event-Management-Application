# Event-Management-Application
## An application that  provides a publishing channel for organizers and an event searching(in terms of name,location, dates, artist and price) for generals.

**Why am I interested to me?**

For me, I like to release my stress by attending various performances or events. 
Therefore, I want to create an app for myself where I can check out recent events. 
With this app, whenever I want to attend an event, 
I can quickly find an appropriate event (in terms of location, dates, artist and price) 
for me. However, why not expand the idea and make the app available to event organizers as well. 
Event organizers could add their own event information,
and users (not just myself anymore!) can go and look up information about each event too!

**Who will use it?**

1.Event Organizers

2.People who wants to find some events to participate
